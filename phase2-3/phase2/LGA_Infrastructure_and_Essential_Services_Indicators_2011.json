Modeled on the World Economic Forums Global Competitiveness Report, [In]Sight was developed in collaboration with Deloitte Access Economics and combines data from sources including the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Social Health Atlas of Australia.<br/><br/>Infrastructure and transport (and, by extension, essential services) are crucial elements in determining the location of, and type of, investment activities and business sectors that can develop in a region.<br/><br/>Well-developed infrastructure, particularly dependable electricity and telecommunications systems are an integral component of business production. Similarly, effective transport systems are vital in allowing regions to move their goods and services in a secure and timely fashion. Both of these measures directly influence a region's competitiveness as they improve the region's ability to host economic activities through adequate infrastructure and also increase the region's ability to interact with other markets.","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"LGA2011","type":"java.lang.Integer","title":"LGA Code","description":"The ABS code of the LGA","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"AHS_meas","type":"java.lang.Double","title":"Access to allied health services","description":"Measurement: % of workforce employed in health services (excluding hospitals) (Source: ABS Census 2011 - Table builder, industry of employment by LGA)","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"GPsrv_meas","type":"java.lang.Double","title":"Access to GP services","description":"Measurement: Number of GP services per capita (Source: Social Health Atlas of Australia)","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"HS_meas","type":"java.lang.Double","title":"Access to hospital services","description":"Measurement: Number of people employed in hospitals in a region per resident population (Source: ABS Census 2011 - Table builder, industry of employment by LGA)","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"v_meas","type":"java.lang.Double","title":"Access to primary education services","description":"Measurement: Distance to nearest primary school (km) (Source: MySchools Data)","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"DisSS_meas","type":"java.lang.Double","title":"Access to secondary education services","description":"Measurement: Distance to nearest secondary school (km) (Source: MySchools Data)","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"tfe_meas","type":"java.lang.Double","title":"Access to technical or further education","description":"Measurement: % of working age population attending technical or further education institutions (Source: Source: ABS Census 2011 - Table builder, Educational attendance by LGA, ABS Census 2011 - Table builder, population by LGA)","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"tes__meas","type":"java.lang.Double","title":"Access to tertiary education services","description":"Measurement: % of working age population attending university or another higher education institution (Source: ABS Census 2011 - Table builder, Educational attendance by LGA, ABS Census 2011 - Table builder, population by LGA)","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"Avi_meas","type":"java.lang.Double","title":"Aviation Infrastructure","description":"Measurement: Distance to and from region's business centre to nearest airport (km) (Source: GIS Calculations)","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"Hosp_empl","type":"java.lang.Double","title":"Hospitals (except Psychiatric Hospitals)","description":"Number of Hospitals (except Psychiatric Hospitals) within the LGA","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"AHS_Empl","type":"java.lang.Double","title":"Industry of employment (health and social services)","description":"Number of people working in health and social services in the LGA","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"AHS_LbFrce","type":"java.lang.Double","title":"Labour Force","description":"Total Labour Force in the LGA","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"LGA_Name","type":"java.lang.String","title":"LGA Name","description":"The name of the LGA","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"NumGP_Srv","type":"java.lang.Double","title":"Number of GP services","description":"Total number of GP services within the LGA","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"tes_attppl","type":"java.lang.Double","title":"Persons attending a higher education institution","description":"total number of Persons attending a higher education institution in the LGA","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"tfe_attppl","type":"java.lang.Double","title":"Persons attending a technical or further education institution","description":"Total number ofPersons attending a technical or further education institution in the LGA","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"ResPop","type":"java.lang.Double","title":"Resident population","description":"Total Resident population within the LGA","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"wkage_pop","type":"java.lang.Double","title":"Working age (15-64 years)","description":"Total number of persons of Working age (15-64 years)","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false}],"filter":{"filterType":"tabular","feature":{"key":"LGA2011","geoLevel":"lga2011","geoField":"ignored","year":"2006","featureBbox":[140.961681984,-39.159189527500004,149.976679008,-33.9806475865],"featureType":"ste","featureInstance":"2","featureName":"Victoria","referenceSystemIdentifier":"EPSG:4283","prefix":"","keyTransform":null},"states":["2"]}}
